		<h1>Server initialisation partially done and reboot required!</h1>
		<br/><br/>
		The server is currently shutting down, because its configuration was modified in a way that requires
		a reboot!
		<br/><br/>
		You have to start it again manually, if you don't have a watchdog (service monitor) installed.
		<br/><br/>
		Your desired organisation was <b>not</b> yet created! It will be created when the server starts the next time.
