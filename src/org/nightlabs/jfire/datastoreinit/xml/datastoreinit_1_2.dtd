<!NOTATION DatastoreInitialisation.1_2 PUBLIC

<!--
This is the XML DTD for the initialisation of datastores done by
JFire. All datastore initialisation metadata descriptors must
include a DOCTYPE of the following form:

	<!DOCTYPE datastore-initialisation
		PUBLIC "-//NightLabs GmbH//DTD Datastore Initialisation 1.2//EN"
		"http://www.nightlabs.de/dtd/datastoreinit_1_2.dtd">

Every file must be named "datastoreinit.xml" and it must be located
in the META-INF directory of the JAR.

Here is an example:
	- - - example - - -
	<!DOCTYPE datastore-initialisation
		PUBLIC "-//NightLabs GmbH//DTD Datastore Initialisation 1.2//EN"
		"http://www.nightlabs.de/dtd/datastoreinit_1_2.dtd">
	<datastore-initialisation>
		<init bean="jfire/ejb/JFireSimpleTrade/SimpleTradeManager" method="dosomething" priority="200">
			<depends
					module="JFireTrade.ear"
					archive="JFireTrade.jar"

					method="dosthbefore" />

			<depends
					module="AnotherModule.ear"
					resolution="optional"	/>

<!--
	The datastore-initialisation element is the root element.
	It contains the following elements:
		- init (one or more)
-->
<!ELEMENT datastore-initialisation (init+)>

<!--
	The "init" element defines one call of one method of a given bean. The bean
	will be instantiated and the method called. If there are multiple calls on
	the same bean configured, the bean will be created multiple times, because it
	is anyway unlikely that an initialisation makes multiple calls on the same
	bean necessary.

	The "init" element has the following attributes:
		- bean (necessary)
		- method (necessary)
		- priority (optional, defaults to "500")
	And it contains the following child nodes:
		- depends (zero or more)

	The attributes have the following meaning:
		- bean:
				The JNDI name of the bean which will be used to obtain the home
				interface. The bean itself will be obtained by calling the create
				method of this home.
		- method:
				The name of the method to call. This method must not have any
				parameters.
		- priority:
				A number from 0 to 999 where 0 is the highest priority. If you omit
				this attribute, it defaults to 500. You should not assign values below
				100 and above 899, if you don't know what you're doing.
-->
<!ELEMENT init (depends*)>
<!ATTLIST init bean CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST init method CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST init priority CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	The "depends" element defines another "init" declaration which should
	have been done before. If a declared *required* dependency does not exist,
	the initialisation will be aborted with an error. On the contrary, a missing
	*optional* dependency won't cause any harm to the initialisation.

	If there are multiple "depends" declarations, the method will be called
	after all have been called. If there is a circular dependency, the
	initialisation will be aborted..

	The "depends" element has the following attributes:
		- module (necessary)
		- archive (optional)
		- bean (optional)
		- method (optional)
		- resolution (optional)

	These attributes have the following meaning:
		- module:
				Defines the name of the J2EE enterprise archive. Example:
				"JFireBase.ear"
		- archive:
				Defines another archive in the form "ArchiveName.jar" where the
				other init is defined in.
		- bean:
				Same as the one in the other init declaration.
		- method:
				Same as the one in the other init declaration.
		- resolution:
				States if the dependency is required or optional.

	If at least one of archive, bean or method is empty or missing, all declared
	inits which match the declared attributes, are understood as dependencies. In
	other words: If you declare only module="JFireTrade.ear" as dependency and omit
	archive, bean and method, then all inits declared by the module JFireTrade.ear
	must first be executed, before your init will be launched.
