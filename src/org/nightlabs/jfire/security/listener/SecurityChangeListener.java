/**
 * A listener that is notified whenever access rights are changed. Users of this listener
 * framework should subclass <code>SecurityChangeListener</code> and override
 * all appropriate callback-methods (the ones beginning with "on_", "pre_" and "post_").
 * Whenever a modification occurs, all persistent instances (the complete extent) are iterated
 * and triggered.
 * <p>
 * Note, that there might occur many modifications in the same transaction. In order to reduce
 * workload, you should track all changes (preferably in a non-persistent non-static field of your
 * subclass) until {@link #on_SecurityChangeController_endChanging()} is called. This marks the
 * end of such a series of modifications. It is recommended to - if possible - perform all expensive
 * work in an <a href="https://www.jfire.org/modules/phpwiki/index.php/Framework%20AsyncInvoke">asynchronous invocation</a>
 * that you spawn in your implementation of <code>on_SecurityChangeController_endChanging()</code>.
