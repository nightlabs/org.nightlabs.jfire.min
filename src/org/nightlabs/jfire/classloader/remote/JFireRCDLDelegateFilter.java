	 * This method is called by {@link JFireRCDLDelegate#getResources(String, boolean)}.
	 * Because that method (the implementation of <code>org.nightlabs.classloader.ResourceFinder#getResources(String, boolean)</code>
	 * (from the plugin org.nightlabs.jfire.base.j2ee) is called only once for every resource,
	 * this class does not need to remember the already-queried resource names.
	 * <p>
	 * The currently only (known by us) implementation of this filter is
	 * the class <code>org.nightlabs.jfire.base.j2ee.RemoteResourceFilterRegistry</code>
	 * in the project <code>org.nightlabs.jfire.base.j2ee</code>.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Important API change:</b> Because of deadlocks, we removed some synchronizations. Now this method might be called by
	 * multiple {@link Thread}s concurrently! Additionally, it might happen, that multiple Threads query the same resource
	 * (while the first one is still obtaining it, before putting it into a <code>Map</code> for later short-cuts).
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param name The resource that is searched and could be loaded from the server (it does exist there and is published - that
	 *		has been checked before).
	 * @return Return <code>true</code> if you want to allow that the resource is loaded from the server. Return <code>false</code>,
	 *		if you want to filter the resource out (in order to force a local lookup or a failure, if it doesn't exist locally).
