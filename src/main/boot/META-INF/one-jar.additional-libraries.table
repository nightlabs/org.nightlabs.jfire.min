# This file contains the libraries needed during installation. Since they are already
# contained in the installation-package (=> jboss), it makes no sense to put them somewhere
# else a second time (thus, we can't put them into the lib directory, which is recognized
# by one-jar automatically). Therefore, we simply register them in this file.

# hsql and mckoi aren't supported anymore. Marco.

# The ServerConfigurator is now executed via the Launcher - hence, we don't need any DB drivers here anymore.

#jfire-server/server/default/lib/derby.jar

# We use the MySQL driver to test whether the coordinates entered by the user are correct (rather than waiting for an exception later).
