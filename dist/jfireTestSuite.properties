## This is the main properties file controlling the JFire Test Suite. It is expected in the
## directory ${deploy}/JFire.last/JFireTestSuite.ear/ of your JBoss server.
##
## This file supports include files. Include files can include other include files. An include
## file overrides the settings made in the file which declares the include. That's why you are
## encouraged, not to change this file but instead create e.g. the include file in your user
## home directory declared by the include below.
##
## In order to define an include file, you declare a property with the prefix "include.". You
## can add whatever you want as suffix. The include directives are processed in alphabetic order
## of the include property keys (e.g. "include.0" would be processed before "include.1").
##
## If an include file defines further include files, they will be read first before stepping up
## again in the recursion (i.e. a recursion-sub-branch is processed completely before the sibling).
##
## The value of an include directive - i.e. the include file you declare - can contain system
## properties. They are enclosed in "${" and "}". For example, if you want to read the file
## "myfile.properties" in your home directory, you'd declare "${user.home}/myfile.properties".
##
## If an include file does not exist, it is not a blocking error; only a simple INFO message will
## be logged!

## If you want personal settings, you are encouraged to create the following file in your home directory
## rather than changing this file!
include.userhome=${user.home}/.jfireTestSuite.properties

## You can define multiple listeners by using the "listener." prefix, followed by the name of the listener
## and then adding the configuration key as suffix. For example, you can declare 2 listeners
## like this:
##   listener.myFirst.class=my.package.MyListener1
##   listener.myFirst.another.key=whatever_value
##   listener.mySecond.class=my.package.MyListener2
##   listener.mySecond.another.key=whatever_value

## BEGIN configuration for "Default" listener.
listener.Default.class=org.nightlabs.jfire.testsuite.DefaultTestListener
listener.Default.xmlReport.enabled=true
listener.Default.xmlReport.fileName=testReport.xml

## who ever wants to get some test stats should create an include file with the following properties
## (alternatively you could change the following lines, but an include file is recommended).
listener.Default.mail.alwaysSend.enabled=false
listener.Default.mail.onFailure.enabled=false
listener.Default.mail.onSkip.enabled=false

## Which outgoing mailserver should be used?
listener.Default.mail.smtp.host=

## How shall we identify (i.e. who is the sending host)?
listener.Default.mail.smtp.localhost=

## The email address of the sender?
listener.Default.mail.from=info@jfire.org

## The destination email address?
listener.Default.mail.to=

## The subject to be used?
listener.Default.mail.subject=JFire Server Test Report

## The XSL used to generate the HTML file to be sent?
listener.Default.mail.htmlReportXSL=htmlReport.xsl
## END configuration for "Default" listener.
