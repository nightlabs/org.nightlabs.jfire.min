This directory serves for storing the XML config of JFire. Because not all settings can
be stored in a database (e.g. which databases to use), we use this XML configuration
for global settings and a kind of entry point.

You MUST NOT delete this directory! You can however delete all files within it (keeping
this readme-file is recommended, though).

This Config-README.txt file serves two purposes:
	- give you some information
	- ensure that the config directory is included in packages and extracted during
	  installation (sometimes empty directories are ignored).
