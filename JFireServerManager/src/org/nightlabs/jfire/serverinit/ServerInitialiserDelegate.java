/**
 * <p>
 * This is the base class for all server initialisers. A ServerInitialiserDelegate is triggered,
 * whenever the server boots after all other initialisation is done. In most of the use
 * cases, you'd probably prefer to use the datastore initialisation mechanism as
 * <a href="https://www.jfire.org/modules/phpwiki/index.php/HowToDataStoreInit">described in the wiki</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Currently, there can only be one ServerInitialiserDelegate per EAR. You register it by placing
 * a file called <code>serverinit.properties</code> into the EAR directory (parallel to
 * the *.jar, *.war and *.rar files). Into this <code>serverinit.properties</code>, you declare
 * your initialiser as value to the property <code>serverInitialiser.class</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <u>Example:</u><br/>
 * <code>
 * serverInitialiser.class=org.nightlabs.jfire.chezfrancois.ChezFrancoisServerInitialiser
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Important note:</b> This registration mechanism might soon be changed in order to
 * be controlled by XML files similar to the datastore initialisation (with dependency
 * declarations). Stay tuned on http://www.jfire.org
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If there are multiple EARs declaring server initialisers, the EARs are ordered by their
 * directory name.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A common use case for the <code>ServerInitialiserDelegate</code> is the setup of a demo system,
 * because this requires to create one or more organisations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For the setup of a demo system, it is recommended to combine the server init with the
 * datastore init: Declare a ServerInitialiserDelegate only for the creation of the necessary
 * datastores and populate the demo data via the datastore init. When doing that, you must
 * of course check the organisation id in your datastore init beans!
 * </p>
