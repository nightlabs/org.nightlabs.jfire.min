<!NOTATION ServerInitialisation.1_1 PUBLIC
          "-//NightLabs GmbH//DTD Server Initialisation 1.0//EN">
<!--
This is the XML DTD for the initialisation of a JFire server
upon startup.

All server initialisation metadata descriptors must include a
DOCTYPE of the following form:

	<!DOCTYPE server-initialisation
		PUBLIC "-//NightLabs GmbH//DTD Server Initialisation 1.0//EN"
		"http://www.nightlabs.de/dtd/server-init_1_0.dtd">

Every file must be named "server-init.xml" and it must be located
in the META-INF directory of the JAR.

Here is an example:
	- - - example - - -
	<!DOCTYPE server-initialisation
		PUBLIC "-//NightLabs GmbH//DTD Server Initialisation 1.0//EN"
		"http://www.nightlabs.de/dtd/server-init_1_0.dtd">
	<server-initialisation>
		<early-init class="org.nightlabs.jfire.chezfrancois.ChezFrancoisServerInitialiser" priority="200">
			<depends
					module="Dependency.ear"
					archive="Dependency.jar"
					class="org.nightlabs.jfire.dependency.DependencyServerInitialiser" />

			<depends
					module="AnotherModule.ear"
					resolution="required" />
		</early-init>

		<late-init class="org.nightlabs.jfire.AnotherServerInitialiser" />
	</server-initialisation>

<!--
	The server-initialisation element is the root element.
	It contains the following elements:
		- init (one or more)
-->
<!ELEMENT server-initialisation (early-init*,late-init*)>

<!--
	The "early-init" and "late-init" elements define a class that must extend IServerInitialiser.
	The given Initialiser is instantiated and its method initialise() called, after the execution
	order has been determined by resolving dependencies between Initialiers.
	
	All "early-init"s are executed *before* all declared organisation inits whereas all "late-init"s
	are executed *after* all declared organisation inits.

	Both element have the following attributes:
		- class (necessary)
		- priority (optional, defaults to "500")
	And it contains the following child nodes:
		- depends (zero or more)

	The attributes have the following meaning:
		- class:
			The implementor of IServerInitialiser that is supposed to do the initialisation.
		- priority:
			A number from 0 to 999 where 0 is the highest priority. If you omit
			this attribute, it defaults to 500. You should not assign values below
			100 and above 899, if you don't know what you're doing..
-->
<!ELEMENT early-init (depends*)>
<!ATTLIST early-init class CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST early-init priority CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!ELEMENT late-init (depends*)>
<!ATTLIST late-init class CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST late-init priority CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	The "depends" element defines another "init" declaration which should
	have been done before. If a declared *required* dependency does not exist,
	the initialisation will be aborted with an error. On the contrary, a missing
	*optional* dependency won't cause any harm to the initialisation.
	
	When defining dependencies, you have to be aware, that inits of a type (early-init
	or late-init) can only have dependencies of the *same* type.
	I.e. dependencies from late-inits on early-inits or vice versa are not possible

	If there are multiple "depends" declarations, this initialisation will be performed
	after all dependent ones have been called. If there is a circular dependency, a
	warning will be logged and the inits will be performed in arbitrary order.

	The "depends" element has the following attributes:
		- module (necessary)
		- archive (optional but necessary when "class" is given)
		- class (optional)
		- type (optional)
		- resolution (optional)

	These attributes have the following meaning:
		- module:
			Defines the name of the J2EE enterprise archive. Example: "JFireBase.ear"
		- archive:
			Defines another archive in the form "ArchiveName.jar" where the required init is
			defined in.
		- class:
			The implementor of IServerInitialiser that is supposed to do the initialisation.
		- resolution:
			States if the dependency is required or optional.
			
	If at least one of archive or method is empty or missing, all declared
	inits which match the declared attributes, are understood as dependencies. In
	other words: If you declare only module="JFireTrade.ear" as dependency and omit
	archive and class, then all inits declared by the module JFireTrade.ear
	must first be executed, before your init will be launched.
